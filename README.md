Advent of Code 2022 (for more informations see https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Note on the dataloader: 
if you want to use my dataloader to avoid to manually copy/paste your daily inputs, you will need to create a SESSION.txt file at the project's root that contains your session cookie. Thanks a lot to [Betaveros](https://github.com/betaveros/) for the tip !!!
